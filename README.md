# AsteroidPhotometry
Master thesis on new automatic procedure for asteroid photometry.

Based on [mommermi/photometrypipeline](https://github.com/mommermi/photometrypipeline).

Example_data contains 6 examples to create light curves. It also contains plots made in xmGrace to compare.

LCDB directory should contain Light Curve Data Base from http://www.MinorPlanet.info/php/lcdb.php named `LC_DAT_PUB.TXT`
Please, always download last version of their database.

List of my programs:

1. Light curve generator - LCurve.py - as output creates .png file with instrumental and relative magnitudes
